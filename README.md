===============
Simple apple script to post from NetNewsWire to Tweetie.app by using the "twitter://" url schema. Script basically taken from [TwitNews](http://blog.tinucleatus.com/?p=204) and changed to work with Twitter.app instead of own scheme.

URL schema documented [here](http://handleopenurl.com/scheme/twitter).
